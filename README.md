# Missile-Run
Repo for unity build missile run game

## Overview
Missile Run is my first attempt to finish a project. I want to complete a game so I can experience all aspects of game design, from the beginning steps to the finishing touches. Missil Run is a simple 4 player online multiplayer games that pits players against each other. After an initial countdown, a missile in the center of the map will start chasing the closest player. Players must make use of powerups scattered across the play area, as well as pillars that block the missile to survive and be the last player alive.
